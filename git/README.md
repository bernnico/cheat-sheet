## Writing Good Git Commit Messages
A good Git commit message is clear, concise, and accurately describes what was changed and why. Here are some best practices for writing effective Git commit messages:

### Structure of a Good Git Commit Message
1. **Short Title (50 characters or less)**
   - Describes the change succinctly and precisely.
   - Starts with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Fix", "Add", "Update").

2. **Blank Line**

3. **Detailed Description (optional, 72 characters per line)**
   - Explains what and why the changes were made.
   - Describes the context and potential impact of the change.
   - Can include multiple paragraphs, lists, or bullet points if needed.

### Example of a Good Commit Message
Add user authentication to the login module

This commit implements the user authentication functionality in the login
module. It includes:

Basic login form with username and password fields
Validation of user credentials against the database
Session management to keep users logged in
This change is necessary to ensure that only registered users can access
the protected areas of the application. Future enhancements will include
OAuth support and better error handling.

### Tips for Good Commit Messages
1. **Be precise and descriptive**: Ensure that someone reading the commit message can understand the changes without additional context.
2. **Avoid generic messages**: Messages like "Fix bug" or "Update code" are not helpful. Instead, describe the specific issue and how it was resolved.
3. **Use active verbs**: Start the message with an active verb in the present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Remove").
4. **Keep the title short and concise**: The title should be no longer than 50 characters.
5. **Separate title and description**: Use a blank line between the title and the description.
6. **Use the description to explain**: Use the detailed description to explain the "why" of the change.

### Common Verbs for Commit Messages
- **Add**: Adding new features, files, or tests.
- **Fix**: Fixing bugs.
- **Remove**: Removing code, files, or features.
- **Update**: Updating existing features, files, or tests.
- **Refactor**: Restructuring code without changing functionality.
- **Improve**: Improving the existing implementation.
- **Optimize**: Optimizing performance or resource usage.
- **Document**: Adding or updating documentation.

### Sample Commit Messages for Various Scenarios

#### Adding a New Feature
Add new feature for exporting data to CSV

Implemented functionality to export user data to a CSV file.
Included options for specifying delimiter and character encoding.
Added unit tests to verify the correctness of the exported data.

#### Fixing a Bug
Fix null pointer exception in user profile update

The null pointer exception occurred when updating a user profile with
empty optional fields. Added checks to ensure that all optional fields
are properly initialized before updating the profile.

#### Refactoring Code
Refactor user authentication logic

Extracted the user authentication logic into a separate service class.
This improves code readability and makes it easier to extend the
authentication process in the future. No changes in functionality.

#### Updating Documentation
Document new API endpoints for user management

Added documentation for the new API endpoints introduced in the
user management module. This includes detailed information about
each endpoint, expected input, and output formats.
